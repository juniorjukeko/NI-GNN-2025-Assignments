## Submissions

### Homework 1
- Topic: Exploration of the ICIJ Offshore Leaks dataset
- Dataset: ICIJ Offshore Leaks dataset

### Homework 2
- Topic: GNN models comparison using dgl library
- Dataset: COX2 dataset from TUdataset (Binary graph classification)
- Architecture: GCN, GraphSAGE
- Highlights: Architecture comparison, training curves, confusion matrix

### Homework 3
- Topic: Comparing explainer results for GNN models using pytorch-geometric library
- Dataset: Amazon Computers (Multiclass node classification)
- Methods: GNNExplainer
- Highlights: Feature importance, explanation subgraph, explanation fidelity, unfaithfulness analysis

### Final Project
NOTE to Lecturer: For the final project written submission there's a possibility that I can't manage to upload all of the written report a few days before the exam (late submission), and I'm really sorry about this. However, I should be able to put up a presentation before the exam. I accept if there is any point penalty from this late(incomplete) submission.
- Topic: Multiclass graph classification for enzyme classification
- Dataset: ENZYMES from TUdataset
- Models: GCN, GraphSAGE, GIN, GATv2
- Results: Accuracy, explanation quality, confusion matrix

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements
